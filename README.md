ðŸ“Œ 60-Day Verilog Coding Challenge ðŸš€
Welcome to my 60-Day Verilog Coding Challenge! In this repository, I will be sharing my daily Verilog coding exercises, solutions, and key learnings as I progress through RTL design, digital circuits, and hardware description concepts.

ðŸ”¹ Challenge Goal:

Strengthen my Verilog programming skills from basic to advanced.
Explore RTL design, digital circuits, and FPGA-based implementations.
Improve debugging and verification techniques for efficient hardware design.

ðŸ”¹ Daily Progress:
âœ” Day 0: Hello, World!
âœ” Day 1: Logic_Gates (Coming Soon...)


ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies:
ðŸ›  Language: Verilog HDL
ðŸ–¥ Simulation: Xilinx Vivado / EDA Playground / ModelSim / QuestaSim 
ðŸ“¡ Target Hardware: FPGA / ASIC

ðŸ“Œ Follow this repository to stay updated! ðŸš€
